# pelican-zweifeln

Pelican theme, loosly based on ["notmyidea"](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/tree/main/pelican/themes/notmyidea), minimalistic, removed lots of the templates, I don't need, simplified the CSS-files.
Added podcast-support. Podcasts need their own category and that category needs to added as a folder in the content-folder - and added to the STATIC_PATHS in the config file(s).

It mainly serves as my minimal theme to fork for other small projects with other colors / designs but a similar general aesthetic.
